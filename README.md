RepublikaMladi 
===============

RepublikaMladi is a Django based application that has a blog and debate module included. 
The debate module idea is taken from my GSoC project: [Ecidadania](https://github.com/cidadania/e-cidadania).

Web design by [Ana Risteska](https://github.com/anarisris).

See the demo here: [RepublikaMladi](http://republikamladi.mk/).

For the application to run you need:  
1. [django-registration](http://docs.b-list.org/django-registration/0.8/);
2. [django-socialregistration](https://github.com/flashingpumpkin/django-socialregistration);
3. [django-ratings](https://github.com/dcramer/django-ratings).
